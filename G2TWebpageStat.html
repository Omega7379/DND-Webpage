            <!--Intro-->
            By now you have probably recorded your character's information on a character sheet. If you have not there is a link below to a pdf file.
            On the sheet you will notice <b>6</b> boxes labelled <em>Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Wisdom, Intelligence</em> and <em>Charisma</em>. Those of you who
            have played table top rpg games before, you are probably aware of what each one is. For those who do not lets break it down. <em>Strength</em>
            is what allows a character to carry a certain amount of weight. It also determines how well you can hit with most attacks and how hard.
            If we use the tomato analogy Strength is how hard and well you can throw it. <em>Dexterity</em> is often used to dodge attacks, traps, and
            plays into your armor class (AC) which helps you dodge an attack. For weapons with the <i>finesse</i> property your dexterity modifier
            gets used instead of strength for attacking. The tomato analogy for this is essentially how well can you dodge said tomato. <em>Constitution</em>
            is what determines how much health you have, how much you gain on a short rest, how long can you swim or hold your breath, can you
            avoid poison effect or exhaustion. Overall a really useful stat that often gets overlooked by new players in favor of the physical stats. The
            tomato in this case is, "Is it poisoned?", huh I guess it was but I'm fine. <em>Intelligence</em> is your book smarts. How smart are you and do
            you know anything about this item? It used as the spell casting ability for wizards. Intelligence is knowing a tomato is a fruit to put it
            plainly. <em>Wisdom</em> is more street smarts. Just because you may not know everything doesn't mean you suck at your profession. If you need
            to spot something or recall how to survive off of plants, then wisdom will be your friend. It also determines the casting ability for druids,
            fighters (if applicable), clerics, and rangers. Wisdom is knowing a tomato does not go in a fruit salad. <em>Charisma</em> is your vocal style,
            need to persuade someone or something? Want to tell a bold faced lie and get away with it? Maybe you need to put on a performance to
            act or play music. All of these things use charisma as the base stat for skills. Bards, warlocks, paladins, and sorcerors use this as their
            spell abilities. <br/>
        <br/>
        <!--How to roll stats or optional point buy-->
            So now that you have gotten the quick rundown of each major stat block, it is time to roll for stats. If you're using an online resource such
            as <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/">DnD Beyond</a> point buy is a viable option and is really useful if you have something very specific in mind. For those who wish to do the
            traditional way, I use the <b>4d6</b> method. A few other methods exist but I find this the most balanced. In this method we roll <b>4</b> <b>6</b>-sided dice
            drop the lowest number and re-roll <b>1</b>'s. For example I roll <b>6, 4, 1, 3</b>, I take the 1 and re-roll to get <b>2</b>. Therefore drop the lowest and add up
            the rest for <b>13</b>. I would repeat this process <b>6</b> times so I have numbers for each stat. Once that is done I choose which number goes to which
            spot and add up the total score for the stat. There is a handy chart within the Player's Handbook which tells you what your modifier is
            based on the total score. From these modifiers determined by the score we can add up our modifiers for a section called <i>skills</i>. Skill
            modifiers use the base modifier of whatever stat acronym (STR, DEX, INT, CON, WIS, CHA) plus your <i>proficiency</i> modifier if you are
            proficient in that skill. Some classes give <i>expertise</i> which doubles your proficiency mod then adds base stat modifier. Mathematically this
            looks like this - skill = (1 x (expertise) x proficiency) + base modifier. That's a lot of info to take in so let us continue with the example.<br/>
        <br/>
        <!--Example continued-->
            Alright rolling stats, I got <b>18, 12, 14, 13, 13,</b> and <b>15</b>. As a paladin I want my top <b>3</b> scores to be in Strength, Constitution, and Charisma.
            Refer to page 173 for a chart on modifers based on total score. I will put my strength at 18 giving me a <b>+4</b> modifier. For my dexterity,
            I will pick one of the <b>13</b>'s plus <b>2</b> because of the racial trait for a total of <b>15</b> with a <b>+3</b> modifier. Constitution lets go with <b>14</b> for a <b>+2</b>
            modifier. Since we read that the paladin gains <b>1d10</b>+CON modifier with max potential at first level our health points will be at <b>12</b>.
            Intelligence lets go with the <b>12</b> plus racial bonus of <b>+1</b> for a total score of <b>13</b> with a <b>+1</b> modifier. Wisdom let's use the other <b>13</b> with a <b>+1</b>
            modifier. Finally for charisma lets use the second highest score to <b>15</b> with the <b>+3</b> modifier. Looking at the skills section of the character
            there is quite a bit of specific skills, read pages <b>175</b> to <b>178</b> for details of each skill. For now I will just show a couple examples. Athletics
            uses strength as its base stat, so our athletics modifier when we make an athletics check is <b>+4</b>. Thanks to <i>Keen Senses</i> we gain proficiency
            in <em>perception</em> and it uses the wisdom modifier giving us a modifier of <b>+1 +2</b> for a total of <b>+3</b>. repeat this pattern all the way down the list.
            Our armor class (AC) is <b>10</b>+ DEX mod which for our High Elf Paladin is <b>13</b>. refer to the Players Handbook for making the stats for saving
            throws and passive skills. <br/>
